> Spread across `machines`

* Similar to viruses, but they spread between machines
* Some exploit bugs
* Some require manual intervention (e.g "click here to download the latest Justin Timberlake song").
* Some require social engineering (e.g "click here to download Jennifer Lawrence naked pictures").
