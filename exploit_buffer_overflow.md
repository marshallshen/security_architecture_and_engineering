# Exploit Buffer Overflow

* Vulnerable programs (`fgets`, `strcpy`, `sprintf`..)
* NUL bytes
* Uncertainty about address

### Find vulnerable programs
* Use `nm` and `grep` to spot use of dangerous routines
    * nm - list symbols from binary files
    ```
    # nm test.o
    0000000a T global_function
    00000025 T global_function2
    00000004 C global_var
    ...
    ```
* Probe via very-long inputs
* Dissambler: look at source or disassembed/decompiled code

### NUL bytes
* C strings can’t have embedded 0 bytes
* Some instructions do have 0 bytes, perhaps as part of an operand

### Address Uncertainty
* Pad the evil instructions with NOPs $$\rightarrow$$a landing zone or a NOP sled.
* Set the return address to anywhere in the landing zone.
