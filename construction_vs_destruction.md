# Construction vs. Destruction

## Construction vs. Destruction
* An architect and a demolition expert need to know different things.
* Unlike architects, someone is trying to break the structure.
* Some practice: build "tiger team": hire `white-hat` hackers to attack the system.

> If we perceive our role aright, we then see more clearly the proper
criterion for success: a toolmaker succeeds as, and only as, the users of
his tools succeed with his aid. However shining the blade, however
jeweled the hilt, however perfect the heft, a sword is tested only by cutting.
The blacksmith is successful whose clients die of old age.

## Hire tiger team
### Problems of tiger teams
> Imagine a tigner team is hired to assess systems of governments..

* Negotiate how much a tiger team can engage with the system: what can they know?
* Are physical or social engineering attacks allowed?
* What protections (`legal protections` etc.) do you offer the tiger team?
* Whom should be selected? A former hacker? Will they obey to all the compliance?

### Hacking Ethics
> When is hacking `ethical`?

> Under exactly one circumstance: when you have the permission of the person responsible for the system youâ€™re attacking.
