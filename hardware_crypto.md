# hardware crypto

### Random Numbers
* Foundation of cryptography
* There is no `truely random numbers`
* Use hardware to `simulate` random numbers

### Simulate random numbers
> Usage of chaotic processes

* Radioactive decay
* Thermal noise
* Oscillator
* Mouse movement
* Keystroke timing

### Software: pseudo random generator

### Hardware `vs` Software random number generator
* Hardware values can be true-random
* Output rate is rather slow
* Subject to environmental malfunctions, such as 60 Hz noise
* Software, if properly designed and written, is fast and reliable

> In practice, we use a combination of software and hardware random number generator.
