# Virus
> Spread across `programs`

* An “Infected” program (or floppy)
* When executed, it copies itself to other places of a system.
    > `Question`: how to write a program that writes itself?
*  It may carry an extra “payload” that performs other functions

### Boot sector virus
* Modify boot sector of hard drive
* We don't boot drive that much nowadays, so boot-sector virus is largely extinct.

### Infected Flash Drive
* `autorun.inf` in flash drive is honored by many OS systems.

### Macro Virus
* Viruses can be written in any sufficiently-powerful language
* Word documents (also Powerpoint presentations and Excel
spreadsheets) can thus spread viruses, `using Microsoft Macro language`.
* Word Macro viruses spread in ordinary business!

### Virus-Spreading Patterns
* Boot-sector viruses spread in affinity groups -- floppies were a normal means of communication before networks.
* Program viruses spread by people sharing software, `often improper or illegal`.
