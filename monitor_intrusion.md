# Monitor Intrusion

### Practice
> Maybe you should let the intrusion continue for a while

> Monitor the attacker's activities.

> See where they're coming from.. However, most attackers `cover their tracks`.

### Types of attack
* Many attackers are random: they just want another bot.
* Hack for profit

### Criminal Prosecution
* `DO NOT` proceed forensics yourself! 
* Law and technology: Evidence must be handled `very carefully`.
* Must avoid defense charges of tampering, forgery, misinterpretation; parties with more interest in a case can be potrayed as biased.
* Forensic analysis for crime $$\neq$$ problem solving for engineering!
