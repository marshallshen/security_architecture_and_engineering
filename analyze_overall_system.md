# Analyze overall system

## System Performance
* A property of the system, not any single component.
* Finding bottlenecks is important, however programmers' guess are `often wrong`.
* Major performance improvements generally come from algorithmic changes, not from minor tweaks.
* Build first, then measure, then optimize — but don’t surrender correctness.
