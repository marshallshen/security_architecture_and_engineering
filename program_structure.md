# Program Structure

> We can't build software for `bug-free` , let's build for `bug-resistant`.

## What does `bug-resistant` entail?
* Minimize chances that a bug will occur $$\rightarrow$$ program should be:
    * Small and simple
    * Well-structured
    * Proper modularized
    > Be a better programmer!
* Minimize consequences of any bug that do occur $$\rightarrow$$ system should:
    * Isolate the security-critical sections
    * Be `strongly isolated` between the security-critical sections and the rest.
    * Confine `non-critical` sections from the rest of the system.
