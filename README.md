## What are we going to talk about?

### Security Primitives
* What are the basic mechanisms you can use to secure a system?
* What are the properties of these mechanisms?
* What is the assurance associated with them?

### Security Architecture
* How to put the pieces together?
* How to spot the risky parts?
* How to evaluate an architecture?

### Security Engineering
* Putting the pieces together
* Tradeoffs
* Balancing cost, security, usability, acceptability..

### How to Think About Security
* Security is a property of the overall design
* You do not get security by sprinkling on crypto or by forcing people to change their passwords frequently
* Those can sometimes helpâ€”but bad guys go around strong security, not through it
* Security is a systems property
