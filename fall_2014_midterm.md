1. (15 points) Someone has built a JPG virus embedded in pictures (of kittens?). The picture triggers
a bug in common image display software, thereby infecting the machine. The virus can only infect
other JPGs—but JPGs can arrive via email (including encrypted email), social networks, other web
sites, flash drives, and more. Both desktops and phones are susceptible to the virus. The virus is
highly polymorphic and encrypted; it sometimes changes more rapidly than the virus definitions can be
updated.
What is the best strategy for an organization to stop this malware?

2. (15 points) To aid in generating random cryptographic keys, every employee of a company has a mag
stripe card and a keyboard with a mag stripe reader. To generate a new key, the employee swipes the
card; a secret value from the card is cryptographically combined with the time of day. (Assume that the
combination algorithm is cryptographically correct.) Outline some possible attacks against this system.
If you need to make any assumptions, state them explicitly—and make sure that they’re plausible.
