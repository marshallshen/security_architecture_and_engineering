1. (15 points) Someone has built a JPG virus embedded in pictures (of kittens?). The picture triggers
a bug in common image display software, thereby infecting the machine. The virus can only infect
other JPGsâ€”but JPGs can arrive via email (including encrypted email), social networks, other web
sites, flash drives, and more. Both desktops and phones are susceptible to the virus. The virus is
highly polymorphic and encrypted; it sometimes changes more rapidly than the virus definitions can be
updated.
What is the best strategy for an organization to stop this malware?
