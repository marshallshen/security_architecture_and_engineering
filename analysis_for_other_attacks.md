### TOCTTOU races
`stat()` vs. `fstat()`

`stat()` works on filenames, while `fstat()` works on file descriptors.

The major reason is security: if you first `stat()` the file and then `open()` it, there is a small window of time in between where the file could have been modified (or had its permissions changed, etc) or replaced with a symlink.
