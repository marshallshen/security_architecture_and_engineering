`stat()` vs. `fstat()`

`stat()` works on filenames, while `fstat()` works on file descriptors.

The major reason is security: if you first `stat()` the file and then `open()` it, there is a small window of time in between where the file could have been modified (or had its permissions changed, etc) or replaced with a symlink.

### Disassembler

### Fuzzing
> Single most powerful and used fuzzing tools.

> Trying different inputs to break system, `systematically`.
* Random: no knowledge of input formats.
* Smart: handles input formats, checksum, etc.
* Black box: smart, but with no validation of code coverage.
* White box: systematically test different code paths.


> A way to find input-parsing bugs by randomly or systematically modifying input streams.

> Input data can be generated by mutating valid inputs.
