# Secure Programming

### Challenge
* Most penetrations are due to buggy software.
* Good software design leads to good security.

### Goals
* Avoid bugs
* Enforce security
* Proper components & proper composition

#### Avoid Bugs
* C language is a big problem
    * `Buffer overflow`
        - Character strings in C = arrays of chars
        - No array bounds checking in C
